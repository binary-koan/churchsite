# Churchsite

## Simple Rails setup for churches

In use for the [Lincoln Union Church](http://www.lincolnchurch.org.nz) website.

ChurchSite is a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) app that includes the ability to display and modify various things that a church might want on their website: news, community activities, photos, podcasts, and so on. In terms of core features it's basically complete, but I still consider it beta-quality software. I'm currently fixing bugs and glitches as the Lincoln community find them.
